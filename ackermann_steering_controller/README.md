# Ackermann Steering Controller

- [x] Basic package structure implementing a controller that does nothing in particular, should have plugin, main header file, main cpp file, cmake properly set up, a load-controller test (see other controllers), no parameters, no subscriber or publisher
- [ ] Add all basic subscribers and publishers, doing the least amount of activity, add basic controller documentation (see other controllers)
- [ ] Add the implementation of the controller, subscriber callbacks and publishing to topics, add basic functional tests
- [ ] Expose parameters and add tests that rely on setting parameters
- [ ] Add any more tests that were not added yet
- [ ] Add any new features by implementing the new functionality, adding parameter(s) for it and appropriate tests without changing the default behaviour unless you have a very good reason to do so
